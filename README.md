# Elephant Image Classification Model

This repository contains a deep learning model and accompanying code to classify images of animals as *Elephant* or *Not Elephant*. This project is part of the **Animal Intrusion Detection and Deterrence** system aimed at protecting crops and promoting peaceful coexistence between humans and wildlife.

## Overview

This image classification system is designed to detect the presence of elephants in images. The system can be integrated into monitoring setups for real-time detection and alerts.


## How It Works


1. **Notebook Interface**: Use `main.ipynb` to load the model, preprocess input images, and classify them.
2. **Binary Classification**: Predicts whether an input image contains an elephant or not.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvatkhattak/elephant-image-detection.git
   cd elephant-image-detection
